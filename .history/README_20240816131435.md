# Pokemon_Pokedex_Application

##Overview

This project is a Pokemon Pokedex application built with React. It allows users to view a selection of Pokémon cards, each displaying a Pokémon's name, image, type, and base experience. The project includes several key components that work together to display the Pokémon and determine the winner in a simulated game.

##Components

###1.App
The top level component that renders the Pokegame component.

###2.Pokecard
A component that displays individual Pokemon details including the Pokémon's name, type, base experience, and an image.

###3.Pokedex
A component that renders a list of 'Pokecard' components. It accepts a list of Pokemon as a prop and displays each one using the 'Pokecard' component. It also determines if the hand is the winning hand and displays a message accordingly.

###4.Pokegame
A component thar manages the game logic. It randomly divides a list of Pokémon into two hands, calculates the total experience for each hand, and determines which hand is the winner. It renders two 'Pokedex' components, one for each hand.
